# D
## What is D?
D is culmination of decades of experience implementing compilers for many drivers languages and has a unique set of features
 - high level constructs for great modeling power
 - high performance, compiled language
 - static typing
 - direct interface to the operating system API's and hardware
 - blazingly fast compile-times
 - memory-safe subset (SafeD)
 - maintainable, easy to understande code
 - gradual learning curve (C-like syntax, similar to Java and others)
 - compatible with C application binary interface
 - limited compatibility with C++ application binary interface
 - multi-paradigm (imperative, structured,object oriented, generic, functional programming purity, and even assembly)
 - built-in error detection (contracts, unittest)
